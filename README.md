# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## Execution

* Extract zip file in a folder
* Load index.html in a web browser

## Tests included
* Tests that RSS feeds are present with names and urls.
* Tests menu showing/hiding
* Tests that at least one entry loads when feeds are loaded.


## Resources:
* JQuery: https://jquery.com/
* Jasmine: https://jasmine.github.io/
